Here my solution to obtain centromeric coordinates for hg38:

Go to the Table Browser: http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables
Choose the Mapping and Sequencing group
Select the "Chromosome Band (Ideogram)" track
Select filter, and enter "acen" in the gieStain field
Press "submit" and then "get output"
Each chromosome will have two entries which overlap.

They can be simply merged into a single entry.

echo -e "chrom\tchromStart\tchromEnd" > CentromerePosition_hg38.txt

cat hg38_centromereposition_raw_from_ucsc|grep ^chr|awk '{if (NR%2==1) {printf $1"\t"$2} else {print "\t"$3}}'>>CentromerePosition_hg38.txt
